# TEAK bulldog AI 

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

I made it to experiment with AI, and made AI for both the bulldogs and the runners. As a result it is quite a hypnotic thing to watch.
